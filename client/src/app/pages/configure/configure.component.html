<h1>Configure</h1>

<p>
  This web app is intended to be used with the GoLang API found
  <a href="https://github.com/hudson-newey/habit-tracker/tree/main/server"
    >on GitHub</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to use this app without the API, but you will not be able to
  sync your Todo items and Habits between devices.
</p>

<p>
  The architecture of the API means that you don't always have to have access to
  the server. You can set up the server on a Raspberry Pi at home (not exposed
  to the internet), set the server url to a local IP, and the app will
  automatically sync your data when you are connected to the same network.
</p>

<p>
  You are free to use this GitHub pages hosted version of the application with
  your own hosted server (or without) by inputting the custom URL below, or you
  can host your own instance of the server, client and mobile application using
  the code available
  <a href="https://github.com/hudson-newey/habit-tracker">here</a>.
</p>

<section>
  <h2>Custom Server URL</h2>
  <p>
    If you are using a custom server, please input the URL below. If you are
    using the goal tracker without device syncing, you can leave this blank.
