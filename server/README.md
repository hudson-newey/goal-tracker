# API Server

## Run development server

It is recommended that you have [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) installed so that you get live reloading of the development server.

Once air is installed, run the following command:

```sh
$ air
>
```

### Running the development server without Air

```sh
$ go run main.go
>
```
