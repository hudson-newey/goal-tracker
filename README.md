# Goal Tracker

A goal tracking app that I created because I didn't like the existing applications

A live deployment (without device syncing) can be found at [grathium-industries.github.io/posts/deployments/habit-tracker](https://grathium-industries.github.io/posts/deployments/habit-tracker)

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete goals, habits, tasks, and logbooks
- Associate habits, and tasks with goals
- Log progress on habits and tasks
- Have a "GitHub like" contribution graph for each habit
- Numerical and binary habit types
- A dark mode
- An insane syncing architecture that syncs data between devices
