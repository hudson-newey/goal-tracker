# Goal Tracker

[Deprecated]

I now use this repo to try out new Go + Angular technologies & versions.

Development is now mainly concerned with the tech stack, rather than creating a useful product. 

---

A goal tracking app that I created because I didn't like the existing applications

A live deployment (without device syncing) can be found at [grathium-industries.github.io/posts/deployments/habit-tracker](https://grathium-industries.github.io/posts/deployments/habit-tracker)

- Associate habits, and tasks with goals
- Log progress on habits and tasks
- Have a "GitHub like" contribution graph for each habit
